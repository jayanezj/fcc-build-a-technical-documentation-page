        Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a
        simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
        together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development
        in many areas on most platforms. </p>
      <p>
        The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all
        major platforms from the Python Web site,
        <a href="https://www.python.org/"
           target="_blank">https://www.python.org/
        </a>
        , and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third
        party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other
        languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications. </p>
      <p>
        This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and
        system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are
        self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well. </p>
      <p>
        For a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library. The Python Language
        Reference gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and
        Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference Manual. There are also several books covering Python
        in depth. </p>
      <p>
        This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used
        feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the
        language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs,
        and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard
        Library. </p>

      <p>
        If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For
        example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange
        a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a
        specialized GUI application, or a simple game. </p>
      <p>
        If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the
        usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library
        and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension
        language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application. </p>
      <p>
        Python is just the language for you. </p>
      <p>
        You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best
        at moving around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a
        C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program. Python is
        simpler to use, available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done
        more quickly. </p>
      <p>
        Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for
        large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more
        error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as
        flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger
        problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages. </p>
      <p>
        Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with
        a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start
        learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and
        even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk. </p>
      <p>
        Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no
        compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to
        experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up
        program development. It is also a handy desk calculator. </p>
      <p>
        Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much
        shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
        </li>
        <li>
          statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
        </li>
        <li>
          no variable or argument declarations are necessary.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Python is <i>extensible</i>: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module
        to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to
        libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are
        really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension
        or command language for that application. </p>
      <p>
        By the way, the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with
        reptiles. Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged! </p>
      <p>
        Now that you are all excited about Python, you’ll want to examine it in some more detail. Since the best way to
        learn a language is to use it, the tutorial invites you to play with the Python interpreter as you read. </p>
      <p>
        In the next chapter, the mechanics of using the interpreter are explained. This is rather mundane information,
        but essential for trying out the examples shown later. </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the tutorial introduces various features of the Python language and system through examples,
        beginning with simple expressions, statements and data types, through functions and modules, and finally
        touching upon advanced concepts like exceptions and user-defined classes. </p>

    <header>Using the Python Interpreter</header>
    <article>
      <header><h3>Invoking the Interpreter</h3></header>
      <section>
        <p>
          The Python interpreter is usually installed as <code>/usr/local/bin/python3.8</code> on those machines where
          it is available; putting <code>/usr/local/bin</code> in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to
          start it by typing the command: </p>
        <code class="block">python3.8</code>
        <p>
          to the shell. Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other
          places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g.,
          <code>/usr/local/python</code> is a popular alternative location.) </p>
        <p>
          On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the Microsoft Store, the python3.8 command will be
          available. If you have the py.exe launcher installed, you can use the py command. See Excursus: Setting
          environment variables for other ways to launch Python. </p>
        <p>
          Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the
          interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the
          following command: quit(). </p>
        <p>
          The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion
          on systems that support the GNU Readline library. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line
          editing is supported is typing Control-P to the first Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command
          line editing; see Appendix Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution for an introduction to the keys.
          If nothing appears to happen, or if ^P is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to
          use backspace to remove characters from the current line. </p>
        <p>
          The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty
          device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as
          standard input, it reads and executes a script from that file. </p>
        <p>
          A second way of starting the interpreter is python -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s) in
          command, analogous to the shell’s -c option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters
          that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote command in its entirety with single quotes. </p>
      </section>
      <header><h3>Interactive Mode</h3></header>
      <section>
        <p>
          When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode. In this mode it prompts
          for the next command with the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for continuation lines
          it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...). The interpreter prints a welcome message
          stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt: </p>
        <code class="block">$ python3.8
Python 3.8 (default, Sep 16 2015, 09:25:04)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>></code>
        <p>
          Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an example, take a look at this if
          statement: </p>
        <code class="block">>>> the_world_is_flat = True >>>
if the_world_is_flat: ...
print("Be careful not to fall off!") ...
Be careful not to fall off! </code>

  <section class="main-section"
           id="An_Informal_Introduction_to_Python">
    <header>An Informal Introduction to Python</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some examples:
      </p>
      <code class="block"># this is the first comment
spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
# ... and now a third!
text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."</code>
      <header><h3>Using Python as a Calculator: Numbers</h3></header>
      <section>
        <p>
          The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:
        </p>
        <code class="block">>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 50 - 5*6
20
>>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
5.0
>>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
1.6</code>
        <p>
          The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.
        </p>
        <p>
          Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result (discarding any fractional result) you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:
        </p>
        <code class="block">>>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
5.666666666666667
>>>
>>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
5
>>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
2
>>> 5 * 3 + 2  # result * divisor + remainder
17</code>
        <p>
          With Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate powers:
        </p>
        <code class="block">>>> 5 ** 2  # 5 squared
25
>>> 2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7
128</code>
        <p>
          The equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, no result is displayed before the next interactive prompt:
        </p>
        <code class="block">>>> width = 20
>>> height = 5 * 9
>>> width * height
900</code>
      </section>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section"
           id="More_Control_Flow_Tools">
    <header>More Control Flow Tools</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Besides the while statement just introduced, Python uses the usual flow control statements known from other languages, with some twists.      </p>
      <header><h3>if Statements</h3></header>
      <section>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:
        </p>
        <code class="block">>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
>>> if x < 0:
...     x = 0
...     print('Negative changed to zero')
... elif x == 0:
...     print('Zero')
... elif x == 1:
...     print('Single')
... else:
...     print('More')
...
More</code>
        <p>
          There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.
        </p>
      </section>
      <header><h3>for Statements</h3></header>
      <section>
        <p>
          The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always
          iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):
        </p>
        <code class="block">>>> # Measure some strings:
... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
>>> for w in words:
...     print(w, len(w))
...
cat 3
window 6
defenestrate 12</code>
        <p>
          Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:
        </p>
        <code class="block"># Strategy:  Iterate over a copy
for user, status in users.copy().items():
if status == 'inactive':
del users[user]

# Strategy:  Create a new collection
active_users = {}
for user, status in users.items():
if status == 'active':
active_users[user] = status</code>

      <header><h3>More on Lists</h3></header>
      <section>
        <p>
          The list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list objects:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            list.append(x)
          </li>
          <li>
            list.extend(iterable)
          </li>
          <li>
            list.insert(i, x)
          </li>
          <li>
            list.remove(x)
          </li>
          <li>
            list.pop([i])
          </li>
          <li>
            list.clear()
          </li>
          <li>
            list.index(x[, start[, end]])
